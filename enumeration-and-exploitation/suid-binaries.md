# SUID Binaries

For Linux binaries can have the Set User ID permission set which lets run with the permissions of the owner, which might be different to your current user.

Check for files owned by logged on user (useful for when they have been hidden):

```bash
thrasivoulos@Sneaky:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
